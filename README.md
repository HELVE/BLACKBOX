# HELVE AVR / BLΛCKBOX 
**Experimental Interactive Art & Technology Museum + Habitation Module**

## Iteration 01_

### BLΛCKBOX VR EDITION Λ<->V
*Update:* Make an interactive VR version of the Blackbox for people to visit (similar to Crows Crows Crows Museum). Include Helve HQ headquarters where I can spend time in VR and think about projects - it could contain private project databases. Definitely will hold seasonal events with various types of exhibitions (photo, video, interactive, vj). Hitech Crime concerts would be another location somewhere deep underground? Not sure. Offsite at least. Include lots of Easter Eggs and hidden information with every release/update. Naming: Blackbox Entry?

- make a mockup

## Iteration 02_

### BLΛCKBOX PHYSCIAL EDITION Λ<->V

Today I had a dream I was a head of an interactive art museum experiment called Helve AVR Blackbox. I lived and created projects in that box. Only opened up for a couple of unique exhibitions several times a year for huge profit margins, which in turn allowed me to research tech for extended periods of time.

Woke up and made a mental sketch of that lovely 200m-high dark room structure with giant top bottom ceiling screens and mirror floors (something like ARTECHOUSE).

It included a habitation section suspended from the ceiling of the Blackbox with drone landing zone on the roof and meditation room inside with transparent floors allowing me to sync with the cybernetic trance visuals happening on giant screens down below in the darkness.

My mind seems to be 100% eccentric these days. I'll just follow where it leads me. #perfectfutura

## Notes

---
**Raw structure description from the dream:** 

Helve HQ Blackbox is a rectangular cube-like black aluminum structure that has highdef top to bottom large screens/projections inside for the purposes of experimentation and exhibition. Floor is shiny black almost resembling a mirror to expand the visuals beyond the frames of the visual. Suspension capabilities for screens (for example to create a physical/visual maze inside the structure).

Motion capture greenscreen wheeled platform on demand, some spots underneath the roof (theatre hidden spots), elevator takes you to the habitation module, which is suspended in the middle of the structure, half submerged into the roof level, has a glass roof as well with possibility of dimming the barriers. 

A little bit of the flat sticks out so there is light and access to fresh air. Perhaps 2 floors but rather small. Some rooms have transparent floors with reinforced glass to look down at the vastness of the Blackbox with its massive glowing screens turned on.

The roof itself is a massive lookout and relaxation point and drone landing pad. To access blackbox you go through a small gate for guests. These smaller doors are a part of the massive gates for bigger objects, cars, platforms etc. Ventilation system required, reinforced cube type of infrastructure, at least 150-200m in height, ticket sales for shows, rental for projects.
