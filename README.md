# HELVE AVR / BLΛCKBOX
## Experimental Interactive Art & Technology Museum + Habitation Modules

Today I had a dream I was a head of an interactive art museum experiment called Helve AVR Blackbox. I lived and created projects in that box. Only opened up for a couple of unique exhibitions several times a year for huge profit margins, which in turn allowed me to research tech for extended periods of time.

Woke up and made a mental sketch of that lovely 200m-high dark room structure with giant top bottom ceiling screens and mirror floors (something like ARTECHOUSE).

It included a habitation section suspended from the ceiling of the Blackbox with drone landing zone on the roof and meditation room inside with transparent floors allowing me to sync with the cybernetic trance visuals happening on giant screens down below in the darkness.

My mind seems to be 100% eccentric these days. I'll just follow where it leads me. #perfectfutura

Raw description from the dream: Create Helve HQ Blackbox (rectangular black aluminum structure that has highdef very large screens inside for experimentation and exhibition purposes (like arttechhouse). floor is black as well but shiny, motion capture greenscreen wheeled platform on demand, some spots underneath the roof (theatre hidden spots), elevator takes you to my flat, suspended in the middle of the structure which is half submerged into the roof, glass roof. A little bit of the flat sticks out so there is light. Perhaps 2 floors but rather small. Some rooms have transparent floor with reinforced glass to look down at the vastness of the Blackbox with its massive glowing screens turned on. That’s where I stream. The roof itself is a massive lookout and chill point and drone landing pad. Small gates for guests that are within massive gates for bigger objects, cars, platforms etc. ventilation system required, reinforced cube type of infrastructure, at least 100-200m in height, ticket sales for shows, rental for projects
